dependencies
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/dependencies.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/dependencies)

Deriving dependencies for R packages, R sessions, and documents with embedded R code is an essential part of documenting what packages and libraries are required to be able to re-run code or rebuild a package. The **dependencies** package aims to provide tools for deriving dependencies and using this information to set up an environment containing those dependencies.
